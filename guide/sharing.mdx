# Sharing (Export and Import)

PokeSVG is local-first, so sharing is done by copying and pasting a genome JSON.

## Export

1. Open a mon in **detail view**.
2. Press `EXPORT`.
3. You should see a `COPIED` toast on the screen.

This copies the selected mon's genome JSON to your clipboard.

## Import

1. Copy a genome JSON to your clipboard.
2. Focus the PokeSVG tab.
3. Paste with `Ctrl+V` (or `Cmd+V` on macOS).

Import feedback:

- `IMPORTED`: added to your dex
- `ALREADY`: you already have it (duplicate seed)
- `INVALID`: the JSON payload was invalid or out of bounds

## Troubleshooting

- Clipboard permissions can behave differently on `localhost` vs `https`.
- If paste isn't working, make sure your cursor is not in an input/textarea (PokeSVG ignores paste into editable fields).
