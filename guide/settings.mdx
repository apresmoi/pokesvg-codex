# System Config

System Config controls global settings. Changing settings does not modify mons you already discovered.

## Generator preset

Controls how future discoveries are generated:

- `CLASSIC`: default, tuned for "creature-like" outputs
- `CUTE`: softer palette and rounder tendencies
- `WEIRD`: more extreme ranges and stranger combinations

## Background

Changes the page background:

- `AURORA`
- `GRID`
- `MIST`

## Animations

Turns blink + idle bob animations on/off in detail view.

If your OS/browser has `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled, animations are disabled automatically.
