# Runtime and Commands

## Current status

No runnable application exists yet (no `package.json` / `src/`).

## Expected (to be confirmed during Phase 1)

- Install deps: `npm install`
- Dev server: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Preview/static serve: `npm run preview` (or equivalent)
- Tests: `npm test`
- Lint/format: `npm run lint`, `npm run format`

## Notes

- Stack is expected to be a React SPA (from the initial conversation), but the exact tooling (Vite vs other) is not decided yet.
