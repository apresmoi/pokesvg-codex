# Operations

## Environments

- **Local development**: run the React dev server locally (exact commands TBD in Phase 1).
- **Production**: static build deployed to hosting (user preference: GitHub Pages, needs confirmation).

## Deployment (needs confirmation)

User setup preference (from `/up-init`): GitHub Pages.

Open items:

- Decide deployment mechanism (likely GitHub Actions -> build -> publish to `gh-pages`).
- Decide base path handling (GitHub Pages often requires non-root base paths).

## Docs

- End-user docs live under `guide/`.
- Mintlify is enabled in project preferences (`mint.json` exists).
