# Phase 19 - Steering: Part Pivot Animations (Idle Micro-Motion)

## Intent

Extend monster animations beyond blink + bob by adding tiny, deterministic part-level motion around attachment/pivot points (head sway, tail swish, limb swing).

## Decision refs

- D-048

## Work items (ordered)

- [x] Capture decision for pivot/attachment animations (deterministic, no schema change)
- [x] Create delivery phase to implement

## Completion criteria

- [x] D-048 is appended to project memory.
- [x] A delivery phase exists for implementation.

## Test plan

- Docs-only.
